Question 6:

- true && true
The result is true because of the AND operator

- false || false
The result is false because the OR operator checks if both one of the conditions is valid but since  they're both set to false then the result is false.

- (true && 1 != 2) || (4 > 3 && 100 < 1)
The result is true because the first part of the expression results to true and the OR operator only needs one condition to be true.

- ((10 / 2) > 3) && ((10 % 2) == 0)
The result is true as the left and right hand sides of the equation are true and the AND operator requires both conditions to be true.
